# Calibrate Take Home Test - Coffee Shop

There are no external libraries other than react used so to run you simply need to do an `npm i` to install react and its dependencies and then `npm start` to run the app.

It's ugly, there's some redundance CSS and unnecessary files and the functionality could be better but ultimately it works and I'm decently proud of it given the time constraints. When a user clicks on one of the coffee buttons (left column) that order goes into a queue for the barista. The barista (middle column) will announce the order it is making (working on it for the required 4, 10 or 15 seconds) and then send it to the coffee counter (right column) where it will sit for 3 seconds before being 'picked up'.
